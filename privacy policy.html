			<tr><td>Achiever's Privacy Policy</td></tr> 
			<tr><td>September 14, Saturday</td></tr>
			<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to earn your trust by being transparent about how Achiever works. You should read this policy in its entirety, but unfortunately, I am too lazy to type out all of them :-(  Therefore, you should pay particular attention to these three highlights and try to deduce the rest of the policy from them for yourself :-):</td></tr>
			<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Achiever is designed to make it easy for you to share your information with anyone you want. You decide how much information you feel comfortable sharing on Achiever and you control how it is distributed through your privacy settings. You should review the default privacy settings and change them if necessary to reflect your preferences. You should also consider your settings whenever you share information.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Achiever is not just a website. It is also a service for sharing your information on Achiever-enhanced applications and websites. You can control how you share information with those third-party applications and websites through your application settings and you can learn more about how information is shared with them on our About Platform page. You can also limit how your friends share your information with applications through your privacy settings.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Achiever is a free service supported primarily by advertising. We will not share your information with advertisers without your consent. We allow advertisers to select characteristics of users they want to show their advertisements to and we use the information users share with us to serve those advertisements.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, one more hint, this policy contains eight sections, feel free to skip all of them since I don't feel like typing all of them out:</td></tr>
			<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Introduction</td></tr>
			<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Information We Receive</td></tr>
			<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Information You Share With Third Parties
			<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. How We Use Your Information</td></tr>
			<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. How We Share Information</td></tr>
			<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. How You Can View, Change, or Remove Information</td></tr>
			<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. How We Protect Information</td></tr>
			<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. Other Terms</td></tr>
			<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, thanks for reading this policy.  Enjoy the app and work hard! Carpe Diem! :-)
